# TB-Backend
Hello there !


The following repository was created for my Bachelor thesis. It contains a Backend written with Spring Boot to manage user login (Spring Security), ingredients, dishes, clients and deliveries for the following [mobile food delivery application](https://github.com/yanik23/TB-Frontend). A PostgreSQL database has been used to store the data.
